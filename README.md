# RFLV

An Encoder & Decoder for flv written purely in Rust

# What Rflv does?

Rflv is a low- and high-level abstraction for FLV. It offers some conveniences when working with H264 codec.

# What Rflv doesn't?

Rflv is not an encoder/decoder for h264 or any other codec. Although it has features for working with h264, it requires that it be previously encoded.
